        <h1> Book Addiction </h1>
        <p> 
            People tend to say that reading books is good. However, like any addiction, it can have<br>
            negative effects. When someone is addicted to reading, they might struggle to focus on<br>
            important tasks and can become preoccupied with thoughts of books. If they cannot control<br>
            their cravings, they may skip classes, leading to a decline in their academic performance.<br>
            They might also stop leaving the house and stay up late at night to read, trying to <br>
            satisfy their urge. When they finish one book, they may experience "post-book depression"<br>
            unless they find a new book to dive into.
            <br><br>
            However, just as poison can be used to cure certain ailments, we can turn this addiction<br>
            into an advantage. By managing our cravings, we can set specific times for reading and times<br>
            for working. This way, we can enjoy the benefits of reading while also staying motivated to <br>
            complete our tasks.
